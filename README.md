# News Aggregator

News aggregator that fetch news form Newsapi and writhe the results in a Google spreadsheet.

## Why I want News aggregator

Every morning I read news, to find the news I browse several sites, and in some cases end spending more time scrolling o the sites that reading the news.  

## The Idea
![The_idea](The_idea.png)

A spreadsheet with different sheets, one sheet per topic. Each sheet contain the 4 most relevant news about a topic. In the sheet each row will represent and article, there will be columns with information such as author, source, summery and link to the full article.

## Getting Started

1. Install the libraries.
2. Define the topics to search
3. Get the Google sheets API token as well as NewsAPI key.
4. Execute the scrip.

> for now the script contain hardcoded values, but again, this meant to be a personal project, I will work on it.
