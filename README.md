# News Aggregator

News aggregator that fetch news form Newsapi and writhe the results in a Google spreadsheet.

## Why I want News aggregator

Every morning I read the news to find the news articles. I browse several sites, 
so I spend lots of time scrolling and navigating the web looking for those news articles. 

But clickbait and inflammatory titles sometimes get me to boring hallow articles.

I need a way to get articles from specific sources and a summary so i can decide if i should skip them.

## The Idea
Use News API as a source of articles and use telegram as a delivery method.

I will use a telegram bot where i can type the keywords related to the topics I want news from, 
in the same telegram chat, I will get a list of 3 articles per topic, with a summary and a link to the original article

## Getting Started

1. Install the libraries.
2. Define the topics to search
3. Get the Google sheets API token as well as NewsAPI key.
4. Create Environment variable with the News API and the Telegram bot API.
5. Execute the scrip.

> for now the script contain hardcoded values, but again, this meant to be a personal project, I will work on it.
