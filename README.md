# News Aggregator

This is an implementation of a news aggregator using the API `NewsAPI`.

## WHY

Every morning I read news, news coming for morning brew email, and the Google alerts, additionally, browse websites like Yahoo Finance and some Taiwan digital newspaper. Consuming media in this way, is at best, consuming time, and prompt distractions, coming from different sources.
